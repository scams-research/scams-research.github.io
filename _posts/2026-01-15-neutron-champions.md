At the recent [Neutron Scattering Group Early Career Researchers Meeting], held in Bristol, Andrew, along with his team of [Adam Clancy](https://clancylab.co.uk/) and [Mónica Ledesma-Motolinía](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CNVEj2YAAAAJ&hl=es) won the Neutron Champion Medals (they won a pub quiz and got these really nice medals!).

Alongside this success, Harry is presenting his work "Lost in Translation: Simulation-Informed Bayesian Inference for Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering" in a contributed talk and Andrew will talk about the importance of *good* simulation to enable neutron scattering. Both taking place this afternoon.
