We are excited to announce the **Bristol/Diamond/ISIS Scattering School**, to take place from the 23rd to the 25th of October 2024 at the University of Bristol School of Chemistry.
The aim of this school is to introduce small-angle scattering and reflectometry (covering both neutrons and X-rays) and focus on the analysis of these measurements, looking at scripting and chemical simulation for analysis. 
Specific areas that will be covered include: 
- Command line and scripting basics
- Small-angle scattering and reflectometry
- Model optimisation
- Simulation-based analysis

The school is being organised by the SCAMs@bristol research group in conjunction with Diamond Light Source and ISIS Neutron and Muon Source. 

The event is free to attend but places are limited, registrations will open on the *2nd September 2024*.
