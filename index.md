{{ site.title }} is an academic research group based at the Centre for Computational Chemistry, within the [School of Chemistry](http://www.bris.ac.uk/chemistry/), at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk). 
{{ site.title }} is led by [Andrew R. McCluskey](https://mccluskey.scot), a lecturer in the School of Chemistry, and visiting scientist at [Diamond Light Source](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/) and the European Spallation Source's [Data Management and Software Centre](https://europeanspallationsource.se/data-management-software-centre).

Research in the {{ site.title }} group focuses on developing physics-informed analysis methods for chemical data. 
We work closely with national and international neutron and x-ray scattering facilities to develop analysis approaches that maximise the information obtained from a scattering experiment. 

We are also keen to collaborate on chemical data analysis projects outside of the scattering domain, so please feel free to [get in touch](./contact/).
