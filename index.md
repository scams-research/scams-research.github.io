{{ site.title }} is an academic research group based at the Centre for Computational Chemistry, within the [School of Chemistry](http://www.bris.ac.uk/chemistry/), at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk). 
{{ site.title }} is led by [Andrew R. McCluskey](https://mccluskey.scot), a {{ site.data.people[0].role }}, and Visiting Scientist at [Diamond Light Source](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/).

Research in the {{ site.title }} group focuses on developing and applying mathematical techniques to understand the motions of atoms and molecules. 
In particular, we focus on the use of computational simulation and neutron and x-ray scattering methods. 
This work bridges chemistry and physics with applied mathematics and statistics. 
We work closely with national and international neutron and x-ray scattering facilities to develop analysis approaches that maximise the information obtained from a scattering experiment. 

If you are interesting in discussing science with us, please feel free to [get in touch](./contact/).
