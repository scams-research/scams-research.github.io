Andrew teaches in the [School of Chemistry](http://www.bris.ac.uk/chemistry/), in particular, on the [MSc Scientific Computing with Data Science](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/2023/sci/msc-scientific-computing-with-data-science) program.
He is passionate about enabling better data skills in chemistry students.[^1][^2]

While working at the [Data Management and Software Centre](https://europeanspallationsource.se/data-management-software-centre), Andrew was responsible for the organisation of the [DMSC Summer School](https://indico.esss.lu.se/event/3267/), where he taught about model-dependent analysis of neutron scattering data. 
From 2019-2022, Andrew was a visiting lecturer in the [Department of Chemistry](https://www.bath.ac.uk/departments/department-of-chemistry/) at the [University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk) where he taught on a final year module that aimed to introduce chemists to data skills and Python programming.
