title: Improving accuracy in chemical simulation
---

Chemical simulation is an important tool in the physical sciences. 
Offering an atomistic, or even electronic, insight into the relevant systems of interest. 
However, chemical simulation is computationally expensive and with growing economic and environmental costs associated with compute, it is important the chemical simulation that is run is analysed in such a way that the maximum information if obtained from the minimum simulation. 
To address this problem, we look to improve the analysis methods that are applied to simulation data. 
This has included the development of a Bayesian regression framework for diffusion coefficient estimation,[^1] which has been implemented in the open-source Python package [kinisi](https://kinisi.readthedocs.io).
