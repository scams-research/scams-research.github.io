title: Understanding Diffusion in Chemical Systems
---

A long-term goal of the SCAMs@bristol group is to apply [simulation](./simulation/) and [neutron scattering](./neutron/), along with other complementary techniques, to understand diffusion. 
How atoms and molecules move is of importance to a range of problems. 
From new battery technologies to the function of our cells, diffusion is everywhere. 

In particular, we have begun to consider how atoms and molecules can move in a collective fashion, leading to interesting phenomena. 
Collective motion is complex to probe experimentally and *in-silico*; hence, we are interested in developing new approaches to investigate it.

    Particles may influence each other to affect their motion.
